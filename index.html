		<div class="Instructions">
			This is a website to test the Palindrome Conjecture, which can be stated as follows:
			<br><br>
			If you take any number and add it to its inverse (digits reversed), after repeating the process with the result a finite number of times, will it eventually become a palindrome?
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="Options">
		<div class="Instructions">Enter a range of numbers to test.<br>You can test one number by setting both fields to the same value.</div>
		<div class="Field">Range: <input id="LowBound" type="number" min="1" value="1"> to <input id="HighBound" type="number" min="1" value="200"></div>
		<div class="Instructions">Choose a maximum number of times to check whether a number forms a palindrome.<br>Lower iteration values can result in less accurate answers, but prevent numbers that don't form palindromes from freezing your computer.</div>
		<div class="Field">Maximum Iterations: <input id="MaxIter" type="number" min="1" value="50"></div>
		<div class="Button noselect">Test</div>

	<div class="Note is-hidden">
		<em>Note:</em> If you get many numbers that don't result in palindromes, your iteration count is probably too low. However, due to the limitations of modern browsers, there is a maximum number that the browser can calculate without resulting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow">overflow</a>, which restricts calculation of numbers that require many iterations to produce a palindrome.
		The only non-palindrome I've been able to calculate with this is 196, which is the lowest non-palindrome. <a href="https://oeis.org/A006960">Here is an accurate list of non-palindromes.</a>
